I wrote a program that has the task of managing registration and then, logging in users.
The main page of the program contains two login and registration buttons. After clicking the registration button, a new page will open, which will take the user information for registration from the user.
User information is as follows:

- Username
- Password: hashed (HASH)
- First name and last name
- Email
- Age
- Gender (in the form of a two-option drop-down menu)

After selecting the registration confirmation option, after filling in the above items, the registration page will be closed and the previous page containing the login and registration key will be opened.
Now, if the user attempts to log in, if the username and password are correct, a confirmation message will be displayed, otherwise an error message will be displayed.
